# PlanningPoker

## General Info and Tech Stack

This repository is the source code for my version of a planning poker website. This website uses .NET 6 and implements SingalR to allow all players to get updates as the session progresses.

## Future Plans

The next enhancement will be switching this from deploying as a stand-alone web app to deploy using a Docker container.
